Synopsys Manifest
=================

This Manifest file is a manifest to synchronize all the layers needed
by Synopsys' layer, using "repo" tool.

Here are the commands to retreive the last revision:

Install
-------

The repo tool needed to be installed in your laptop. Install it with (as root):
	# curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > /usr/bin/repo
	# chmod +x /usr/bin/repo

Use
---

Once the repo tool is available, we need to initialize it using our manifest:
	$ repo init -u https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/synopsys-oe-manifest.git
	$ repo sync -j3

If you want a specific revision (such as "morty"), use the init command with "-b" option:
	$ repo init -b morty -u https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/synopsys-oe-manifest.git

You can update at any time the sources using:
	$ repo sync -j3
